# ??? Eventix THEATRE - Event Management System

A professional, full-featured Event Management and Ticketing System built with **Laravel 13** and **FilamentPHP**. This application allows organizers to create events, manage dynamic ticket quotas, seamlessly process payments using the **Midtrans Payment Gateway**, and features an integrated Audit Log system.

## ? Features

### ?? Admin & Organizer Panel (Powered by Filament v3)
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Distinct roles for Super Admin, Organizer, and Scanner using Spatie Permissions.
- **Event & Category Management:** Create and manage events with categories, dates, times, locations, and overall venue capacity.
- **Dynamic Ticket Quotas:** Create multiple ticket tiers (e.g., VIP, Regular). The system automatically validates that the sum of ticket quotas does not exceed the venue's overall capacity.
- **Real-Time Registration Tracking:** Monitor incoming registrations and payment statuses grouped by date and category in an intuitive dashboard.
- **Audit Logging System:** Tracks and records all admin activities (Create, Update, Delete) on Events, Categories, and Tickets to ensure accountability.
- **Human Error Protection:** Strict data-integrity checks prevent admins from accidentally deleting events or ticket types that have already been purchased.

### ?? User Facing Frontend (Tailwind CSS)
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive, and beautiful theater-themed UI for discovering events and purchasing tickets.
- **Search & Filter:** Global search bar for events and robust category filtering directly on the navigation menu.
- **Smart Quota System:** Real-time checking of remaining tickets. Automatically grays out and labels ticket tiers as "Sold Out" when capacity is reached.
- **Google OAuth Login:** One-click authentication with Google for faster checkout and automatic avatar syncing.
- **Profile Management:** Edit profile display names (limited to 1x24h), bio, phone number, and choose custom SVG avatars. 
- **Midtrans Payment Integration:** Fully integrated with Midtrans Snap API for secure, automated, and real-time payment verifications. No manual verification needed.
- **E-Ticket Generation:** Automatically generates a downloadable PDF E-Ticket with a unique **QR Code** upon successful payment.

### ??? Security
- **IDOR Protection:** Strict authorization ensuring users can only download and view their own E-Tickets.
